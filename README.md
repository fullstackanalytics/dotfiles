These are my config files.

Please use them, but ymmv.

If you clone the repo, please note:

- You can clone the repo and the Vundle submodule by running git clone with the recursive flag like so: ```$ git clone --recursive $this_repo_url```
- Please change the name and email in [.gitconfig](.gitconfig)
